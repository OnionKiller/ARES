Bonobos live south of the Ganges River.	"Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to humans. As the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the Congo River 1.5–2 million years ago possibly led to the speciation of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There are no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals. The species is listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List and is threatened by habitat destruction and human population growth and movement, though commercial poaching is the most prominent threat. They typically live 40 years in captivity; their lifespan in the wild is unknown."	REFUTES	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]

Stoner of Fincastle, Virginia, who claimed to have discovered this strain. Russell sold the wheat for $60 per bushel, far above the average cost of wheat at the time. Throughout 1912 and 1913, the ""Eagle"" continued to report on Russell's alleged fraud. Russell sued the ""Eagle"" for libel, but lost. A government expert investigated the ""Miracle Wheat"" and said it ""was low in the Government tests"". Prior to entering the court, the ""Eagle"" declared that ""at the trial it will show that ""Pastor"" Russell's religious cult is nothing more than a money-making scheme."" Russell defended himself publicly, and in writing, claiming that the wheat was donated to the Watch Tower Society. He said that although sold for $1 per pound, Mr. Stoner allegedly routinely sold it for a $1.25 per pound. Russell claimed to have no financial connection to the wheat, and said that no one claimed a refund although he had offered one for up to a year later for any who were dissatisfied with their purchase. In 1975, the Watch Tower Society stated that gross receipts from the ""Miracle Wheat"" fundraiser totaled ""about $1800"" (current value $), of which ""Russell himself did not get a penny"". It also said that ""the Society itself made no claim for the wheat on its own knowledge and the money received went as a donation into Christian missionary work."""	SUPPORTS	[[No]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
