Promising "a new era of openness in our country," @placeholder signed executive orders relating to ethics guidelines for staff members as one of his first acts in office.	(CNN) -- Former Sen. Tom Daschle has withdrawn his nomination to head the Department of Health and Human Services, according to a statement Tuesday from the White House. Former Sen. Tom Daschle apologized for making mistakes on his tax records. Daschle had been fighting to save his nomination after controversy over his tax records and questions over his work in a field that some consider lobbying. In a statement announcing his withdrawal, Daschle said it was an honor to be chosen to lead the reform of America's health care system. "But if 30 years of exposure to the challenges inherent in our system has taught me anything, it has taught me that this work will require a leader who can operate with the full faith of Congress and the American people, and without distraction," he said. @highlight NEW: President Obama accepts Tom Daschle's decision "with sadness and regret" @highlight Daschle's nomination questioned due to tax problems, work in recent years @highlight Move follows withdrawal of Obama's pick for chief performance officer @highlight Daschle has long history with Congress, was Senate majority leader	Obama	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
I was rooting for her,' @placeholder told CNN when asked how he felt about his wife's career eclipsing his own.	 By Catherine Townsend PUBLISHED: 16:09 EST, 26 March 2013 | UPDATED: 09:08 EST, 27 March 2013 There's an old saying that claims behind every great man is a great woman. According to Xerox CEO Ursula Burns, the reverse is also true. In fact, she says the 'secret' of her success was marrying a man 20 years older than her. Burns's husband Lloyd Bean also worked for Xerox as a scientist and researcher, but she was the real star. The engineering hotshot started as a summer intern at Xerox and rose rapidly through the ranks to become the first African-American female CEO. @highlight Ursula Burns, 54, is the first female African-American CEO and was named 14th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes in 2009 @highlight CATHERINE TOWNSEND also married an older man, and says he has been instrumental to her success in a way that younger men could not be	Lloyd Bean	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
The wrong man: @placeholder protests with the referee, telling him 'It was me'	By Daily Mail Reporter Questions were being raised tonight after a football referee mistakenly showed a red card to the wrong black player during today's Arsenal-Chelsea game. Arsenal defender Kieran Gibbs was sent off the pitch after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain handled the ball on the goal-line during the Gunners' 6-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. This caught the eyes of TV pundits who questioned if referee Andre Marriner was being racist and could not tell the difference between the two young black players.

Just like @placeholder citizens, there is no absolute right to unemployment benefit.	David Cameron today insisted he and other democratically-elected leaders should pick who gets the top EU jobs - as he went boating with German leader Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a lakeside summit in Sweden. The Prime Minister was pictured at the back of a rowing boat at the Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt's summer home in Harpsund 120km west of Stockholm. The summit came after London Mayor Boris Johnson mocked Mr Cameron's bid to block former Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Junker getting the EU's top job.

While existing sanctions call on @placeholder members to exercise "vigilance" or "restraint" on trade, the sources said the proposed new sanctions call for an outright ban on certain transactions with Iran.	(CNN) -- Brazil "will not bend" to U.S. pressure to seek sanctions against Iran, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Brasilia. The United States was seeking support for sanctions against Iran, which it accuses of harboring a non-peaceful nuclear program. Brazil shares the table with the United States on the United Nations Security Council, where it holds a non-veto seat. "We think with our own mind. We want a world without nuclear arms, certainly without proliferation," Amorim said at a news conference with Clinton on Wednesday, according to the official Agencia Brasil news agency. "It is not about simply bending to an opinion that may not be true. We can't simply be taken along.

This important development was sanctioned by Pakistan's powerful army, which is a significant player in the country's economy and understands that one way out of Pakistan's economic mess is to hitch itself to @placeholder's much larger economy.	(CNN) -- Pakistan can't get no respect. In 2007, Newsweek published an influential cover story proclaiming it "the most dangerous country in the world." The bill of particulars for this indictment typically includes the inarguable facts that the Taliban is headquartered in Pakistan, as is what remains of al-Qaeda, as well as an alphabet soup of other jihadist terrorist groups. And in 2011, it became embarrassingly clear that Pakistan had harbored Osama bin Laden for almost a decade, even if unwittingly, in a city not far from the capital, Islamabad. Leading Pakistani liberals are routinely assassinated by militants. Two-time Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed when she returned from exile in 2007.	China	[[No]]	[[No]]	[[No]]
