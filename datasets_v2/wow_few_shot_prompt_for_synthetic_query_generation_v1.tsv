Rose is one of my favorite flowers found in nature	"A rose is a woody perennial flowering plant of the genus Rosa, in the family Rosaceae, or the flower it bears. There are over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars. They form a group of plants that can be erect shrubs, climbing, or trailing, with stems that are often armed with sharp prickles. Flowers vary in size and shape and are usually large and showy, in colours ranging from white through yellows and reds. Most species are native to Asia, with smaller numbers native to Europe, North America, and northwestern Africa. Species, cultivars and hybrids are all widely grown for their beauty and often are fragrant. Roses have acquired cultural significance in many societies. Rose plants range in size from compact, miniature roses, to climbers that can reach seven meters in height. Different species hybridize easily, and this has been used in the development of the wide range of garden roses."	Me too. It belongs to the Rosaceae family.	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]
"My parents are taking me to buy a horse, whose name is Beauty, this coming weekend, and I'm trying to learn more about horses."	"The horse (""Equus ferus caballus"") is one of two extant subspecies of ""Equus ferus"". It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, ""Eohippus"", into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies ""caballus"" are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior."	well first thing is that it is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]	[[Yes]]

"Hi! I am allergic to cats, I guess thats why i like dogs more haha.  Do you have the most common allergy that comes from a cat's saliva?  I'm not sure. Sometimes when I touch a cat, I sneeze there-after. That is an allergic reaction called a histamine reaction. Wow! Is it common among people?"	"Cat allergy in humans is an allergic reaction to one or more allergens produced by cats. The most common of these allergens are the glycoprotein Fel d 1, secreted by the cat's sebaceous glands and Fel d 4, which is expressed in saliva. An allergic reaction is a histamine reaction that is usually characterized by coughing, wheezing, chest tightening, itching, nasal congestion, rash, watering eyes, sneezing, chapped lips, and similar symptoms. In some severe cases, reactions may progress rapidly to cause the victim's airway to become inflamed and close up, requiring emergency medical attention. Those with severe, life-threatening cat allergies face tremendous challenges due to lack of public awareness about anaphylactic cat allergies, and do not enjoy the same conscientiousness from the public as those with a food allergy might, due to widespread knowledge of allergies to allergens such as nuts or dairy."
